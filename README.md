## Usage Instruction
--------------
1. Check [Dependencies](#dependencies) for the required tools needed, install it then set up.
2. Run [Xampp](#xampp) and toggle start on Apache and MySQL Modules. 
3. Enter "localhost/ErovoutikaExamWebsite/" at your browsers URL.

### Dependencies 
1. **[Xampp](#xampp)** <br>
2. **[PHP](#php)** <br>
3. **[Code editors](#codeEditors)** <br>
3.1. **[Visual Code](#visual-code)** <br>


### Xampp
1. In the web browser, visit Apache Friends and download XAMPP installer. 
2. During the installation process, select the required components like MySQL, FileZilla ftp server, PHP, phpMyAdmin or leave the default options and click the Next button. 
3. Choose the root directory path to set up the htdocs folder for our applications. For example ‘C:\xampp’.
4. Click the Allow access button to allow the XAMPP modules from the Windows firewall.
5. After the installation process, click the Finish button of the XAMPP Setup wizard.
6. Now the XAMPP icon is clearly visible on the right side of start menu. Show or Hide can be set by using the control panel by clicking on the icon.
7. To start Apache and MySql, just click on the Start button on the control panel. 

# Making server request: Open your web browser and check whether the XAMPP service has properly installed or not. Type in the URL: http://localhost. If you are able to see the default page for XAMPP, you have successfully installed your XAMPP Server.

# To Check if PHP is Working: All the website related files are organized in a folder called htdocs and then run index.php file by using http://localhost/index.php or http://localhost.

### PHP
1. The first thing you have to do is to download the PHP package file of your choice from the official PHP downloads page.
2. You’ll find .zip files available for both x86 and x64 systems, so make sure to download the correct one as per your Windows OS architecture. Also, you’ll have to choose either to download the non-thread-safe or thread-safe version of PHP. If you’re planning to run PHP as an Apache module, the thread-safe version is recommended. However, if you want to run PHP as a CGI module, you can choose either of them!
3. Next, you need to extract the .zip file in the directory where you want to install PHP. A common install location is C:\php. Create the php directory and extract the .zip file contents inside the C:\php directory.
4. The PHP package that you’ve just downloaded already contains two different versions of the configuration file: php.ini-development and php.ini-production. The php.ini-development file is designed and configured for your local development. This has a lot of features enabled which make it easier to test and debug your code, but it makes your software run slower and is not secure for a live site. On the other hand, the php.ini-production file is designed for optimum performance and security. We’re going to use the php.ini-production file.
5. Next, is configure the php.ini configuration file. It’s important to note that we’ve also removed the semicolon in front of the line to make sure it’s not commented. Of course, you need to adjust the above path to match your installation directory. And with that, we’ve finished the php.ini configuration file changes.
6. In the Windows search bar, just type the environment keyword and choose Edit the system environment variables in the search results. Go to the Advanced > Environment Variables section. Edit the PATH environment variable and add ;C:\php to the end. This will make it so you can run PHP just by typing php from the command prompt, no matter what folder you're in.

Finally, reboot the system, and you’re done. You’ve successfully installed PHP in your Windows installation!
